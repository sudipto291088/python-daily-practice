# LeetCode Practice (DSA Foundations)

This repository contains my **daily LeetCode practice** focused on building strong
**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** fundamentals.

The goal is not speed or shortcuts, but **clear thinking, clean code, and correct
time/space complexity analysis**.

---

## Why this repository exists

- To build problem-solving intuition step by step
- To understand **why** an approach works, not just make it pass
- To practice writing **explainable, interview-ready solutions**
- To track long-term consistency in DSA learning

---

## Topics Covered

Problems in this repository focus on:

- Arrays
- Hash Maps (Dictionaries)
- Strings
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack & Queue
- Basic Recursion
- Time Complexity (Big-O)
- Space Complexity

Advanced topics (Trees, Graphs, DP) will be added gradually.
