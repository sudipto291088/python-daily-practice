# Python Daily Practice

This repository documents my daily Python practice, focusing on:
- Core Python fundamentals
- Data structures & basic DSA
- Clean, readable code with comments
- Time & space complexity awareness

Purpose:
Build strong foundations to support work in Data Analysis, Machine Learning,
AI, and Quantitative problem solving.

Each folder represents a focused learning block, not raw experiments.
